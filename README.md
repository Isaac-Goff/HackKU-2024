# HackKU-2024: Info Checker
The goal of this project is to create a Chrome extension capable of doing basic fact checking and bias tracking on news articles.  This extension would work by comparing key words within an article against 
key words from other articles from reputable sources (BBC, The Guardian, etc) that are not the same article, then funneling the information and keywords to ChatGPT in to ask it whether the keywords selected from 
both the user's article and reputable article appear to be saying similar or the same things.  This in theory should determine whether the article the user is reading is trustworthy or not.  In addition to this,
the program will perform a sentiment analysis on the article to see if the article contains mostly positive, negative, or neutral wording to determine whether the article is more likely to be biased or not.  
This information will always be displayed on the user's screen.

This program works into the theme of social good as it will allow users to better determine the reliability of their news sources.  In modern times, news articles are commonly biased or outright fake when
displaying their information, making it harder for the average person to determine what is real and what is fake when browsing common news sources.  This is an issue that can make it hard to find good information 
with which to form our own opinions and make informed decisions.  With this extension, we hope to allow everyone the chance to quickly and easily determine what articles are worth reading and what articles may 
contain bias or misinformation.
